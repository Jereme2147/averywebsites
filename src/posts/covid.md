### Happy to help if I can
For no charge, I will create a website for your school or class if it can help.  It might be helpful to have one spot for resources.  It would just be a quick generic WordPress site for simplicity sake. I'll help you get logged in and creating content. 
[Valle Crucis Kindergarten](http://www.coolhomeschool.site): This took about 2 hours to set up for my childs class yesterday.  It's nothing special, but it's a start.

Again, I'm not charging for this. Let's all try to help others the best that we can.  I'm happy to do this in between the job I'm lucky to still have and home schooling my own. :)
