This site is built with WordPress.  It's a full custom theme and is completely mobile responsive. It features a blog and several custom post types. Any new or edited "services" are automatically added to the services menu and the "vendors" works the same way.  It's very simple for the end user to edit and create if they choose. There's also landing page highlighted services.  There are three currently that can be added to or removed by the user.
