This is my personal portfolio page.  It's built with GatsbyJs using a "Markdown" blog.  "Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax." [-Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)  With Gatsby, a Markdown blog can be stored locally on your PC. This eliminates the need for a [content management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system).

The Portfolio page is very fast and built to perform on a mobile device first, then desktop.

If you follow the link you'll notice a low quality image shows up immediately while the full image is loading.  If your needs require a lot of images, GatsbyJs is almost always the  best choice.
