This page was devloped with a "mobile first" approach.  Most peoples first 
interaction with your business is from the palm of their hand. Using GatsbyJs the images are always scaled perfectly for the screen size.  A low quality image shows up immediately while the full image is loading.  If your needs require a lot of images, GatsbyJs is almost always the  best choice.

    Strength: Test.  Pretty simple. Hit the safest 5 rep max you can.  Lets be picky.  I'd like to see coaches being 
    picky about depth.  A 300# squat above parallel isn't really a 300# squat.  I'd rather see someone improve their form 
    and not increase weight. 
    Metcon: Pretty clear.

    !!!!!!!!!Important!!!!!! First minute is 10 alternating kb ground to overhead.  No Ski Erg. 53/35.  Should see some 100 rep scores.  
* ### 2/5/20
    Most of us have done this.  25+ rounds is legit.

    Strength: Dynamic weight at your own risk lol.  Have fun with that.  Score heaviest. 
    Strength 2: Exercises should be done one after the other with minimal rest. Extended rest between rounds is fine.  Choose your weight for SLRDL and step ups.  I'd avoid a barbell for step ups.  For SLRDL, be sure the hips aren't opening up too far.
